# Pattern-Searching-engine
a regular expression (regexp) FSM compiler and corresponding pattern matcher 

 execute a search for matching patterns within the text of a file whose name is given as a command-line argument. Each line of the text file that contains a substring that matches the regexp is output just once, regardless of the number of times the pattern might be satisfied in that line. 
 
## Regexp specification:

any symbol that does not have a special meaning (as given below) is a literal that matches itself
"." is a wildcard symbol that matches any literal
adjacent regexps are concatenated to form a single regexp
"*" indicates closure (zero or more occurrences) on the preceding regexp
"+" indicates that the preceding regexp can occur one or more times
"?" indicates that the preceding regexp can occur zero or one time
"|" is an infix alternation operator such that if r and e are regexps, then r|e is a regexp that matches one of either r or e
"(" and ")" may enclose a regexp to raise its precedence in the usual manner; such that if e is a regexp, then (e) is a regexp and is equivalent to e. e cannot be empty.
"\" is an escape character that matches nothing but indicates the symbol immediately following the backslash loses any special meaning and is to be interpretted as a literal symbol
square brackets "[" and "]" enclose a list of symbols of which one and only one must match (i.e. a shorthand for multi-symbol alternation); all special symbols lose their special meaning within the brackets, and if the closing square bracket is to be a literal then it must be first in the enclosed list; and the list cannot be empty.

operator precedence is as follows (from high to low):

      escaped characters (i.e. symbols preceded by \)
      
      parentheses (i.e. the most deeply nested regexps have the highest precedence)
      
      repetition/option operators (i.e. *, + and ?)
      
      concatenation
      
      alternation (i.e. | and [ ])
      
## Usage
java REcompile "REGEXP" | java REsearch text.txt

**NOTE: enclosing your regexp command-line argument within double-quote characters
